# checkScore
Step 1 - Check the user’s move compared with the computer’s generated move and provide a winner - output the winner - e.g. Winner is Computer, or Winner is User.

Step 2 - Include a counter for the games played - output how many games each player (Computer and User) has won after each game - e.g. Computer has won 5, User has won 3, out of 8 games.

If this is too easy - expand the game and add lizard, spock to the mix.
